Description:	Basic Game State manager
				Handles a stack of game states
Usage:
An instance of the GameStateManager will need to be provided to any object
that needs to minipulate game state. Recomended usage: provide a getter from
the application class.

	// Sample Game State
	//===================================================
	class MenuState : public IGameState {
	public:
		MenuState(GameStateManager *gsm) : IGameState(), m_gsm(gsm) {}
		virtual ~MenuState() {}
		virtual void Update(float deltaTime)
		{
			m_gsm->PopState(); // removes the top state from the stack

		}
		virtual void Draw() { Insert Draw Logic }
	private:
		GameStateManager *m_gsm;
		Insert any state specific member variables here.
		 - textures, objects, all thoes sort of things.
	};

Given an instance, here's a rundown of usage:

	// Setup
	//===================================================

		GameStateManager *gsm = new GameStateManager();
		gsm->SetState("MenuState", new MenuState(gsm)); // where MenuState is of type IGameState
		// Note: the constructors could be setup to receive an instance of the game state manager
		// allowing them to change state
		gm->PushState("MenuState"); // the menuState will be updated / rendered when the gameSate is rendered

	// Update Loop
	//===================================================
		gm->UpdateGameStates(deltaTime); // all states "pushed" will be updated
	// Draw Loop
	//===================================================
		gm->DrawGameStates(); // all states "pushed" will be rendered
